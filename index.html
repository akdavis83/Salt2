    <h1 class="oxanium-uniquifier">Without light there is only darkness. We hold forth the Word of life and shine bright as lights in this world. It is not our light but it is the light of Christ that is already shining in and through our lives.</h1>

      <h1 class="oxanium-uniquifier">Without truth no one knows the difference between right and wrong. Without the plumb-line of the gospel truth becomes subjective and with no proper standard every man begins to do what is right in his own eyes. The problem with this kind of good is that sin becomes good because there is no understanding of what wrong really is. That is why we need the truth of God's word. Our right and left hands are very basic level of education, where kids first starting to learn are taught. Without the gospel we are spiritually lost.</h1>
